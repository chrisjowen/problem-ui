Idea:

Supply chain manager - shipping

Stakeholders:

- Shippers (anyone looking to shipping cargo)
- Freight for orders (buy spaces on vessel - retailer of transporation)
- Vessel owners (shipping companies - CNCN) - main goal to operate at full capacity 


Shipping lines - main concern being as full or optimal as possible 

Shipping lines plan demand by:

- Directly via Shippers
- Indirectly via Vessel owners

Cost vs transit time...

Issues With This Process

- In house model to forcast demand. 
- Very paper and pencil and email (phone calls) **** important
- If operating at loss either take the hit or cancel 

If Cancel:
- Short window of time means rerouting (has a cost)

If Send anyway:
- Trip could have been avioded anyway
- Adds to the carbon footprint (green environmental)


Solution:

- Levarge predictive AI and machine learning
- Historical and real time learning ()
- 

Questions:

- What data points are there
- What compertition are there 
- Data is at several layers (shippers, )
- Carbon footprint and route planning (maybe additional)
